## Setup ######################################################################

amend Android library is available at [http://amendcloud.com/library/android.zip](http://amendcloud.com/library/android.zip)

### Manual setup

1. Go to [http://amendcloud.com/library/android.zip](http://amendcloud.com/library/android.zip) and download android library.
2. Library is a ZIP archive that could be extracted using any unzip tool.
3. Import library folder as a module in your android project.

## Try it right away

Sign up for a [free account](http://developer.amendcloud.com/Register) so you can try out image transformations and seamless image delivery through CDN.

*Note: Replace `demo` in all the following examples with your amend's `amend name`.*  

Accessing an uploaded image with the `pc` public ID through a CDN:

    http://amend.cloud/demo/image/pc.jpg

![Sample](http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_300/pc.jpg "Sample")

Generating a 150x100 version of the `pc` image and downloading it through a CDN:

    http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/pc.jpg

![Sample 150x100](http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/pc.jpg "Sample 150x100")

Converting to a 150x100 PNG with rounded corners of 25 pixels: 

    http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/r_25/pc.jpg

![Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG](http://amend.cloud/demo/image/w_150,h_100,fit_fill/r_25/pc.jpg "Sample 150x150 Rounded PNG")

For plenty more transformation options, see our [image transformations documentation](http://amend.com/documentation/image_transformations).
 
## Usage

### Configuration

Each request for building a URL of a remote cloud resource must have the `amend_name` parameter set. 
Each request to our secure APIs (e.g., image uploads) must have the `access_key` and `access_secret` parameters set. 


Setting the `amend_name`, `access_key` and `access_secret` parameters can be done either directly in each call to a amend  method, 
by when initializing the amend object.

The main entry point of the library is the Amend object.

	Amend.setAmendName("my_amend_name");
	Amend.setCredentials("my_access_key", "my_access_secret");


### Upload

Assuming you have your amend configuration parameters defined (`amend_name`, `access_key`, `access_secret`), uploading to amend is very simple.
    
The following example uploads a file to the cloud: 

	 Amend.with(this).upload(reqCode, file, new AmendListener() {
	 
		@Override
		public void onSuccess(int statusCode, int reqCode, String imageName) {
			
		}

		@Override
		public void onError(int statusCode, int reqCode, Exception e) {

		}
	});
   
or you can get Image Name return by amend upload api

	string imageName = resp.ImageName;

You can also specify your own Image Name:    
    
    Amend.with(this).upload(reqCode, file, "myFileName", new AmendListener() {
	 
		@Override
		public void onSuccess(int statusCode, int reqCode, String imageName) {
			
		}

		@Override
		public void onError(int statusCode, int reqCode, Exception e) {

		}
	});

	
### Embedding and transforming images

Any image uploaded to amend can be transformed and embedded using powerful view helper methods:

The following example generates the url for accessing an uploaded `pc` image while transforming it to fill a 100x150 rectangle and set on ImageView img

	AmendOptions amendOptions = new AmendOptions().transform(new Transform().width(100).height(150).fit(Amend.FIT_FILL));
    Amend.with(context).load('pc', amendOptions).into(img);

Another example, emedding a smaller version of an uploaded image while generating a 90x90 face detection based thumbnail: 

	AmendOptions amendOptions = new AmendOptions().transform(new Transform().width(90).height(90).fit(Amend.FIT_FACE));
    Amend.with(context).load('woman', amendOptions).into(img);
